Sqnappy - plugin-binary
=======

Copy the shared library (.dll, .so, or .bundle) for your platform to the VM directory.

Especially for Mac: {VM}.app/Contents/Resources

Note: Binaries were compiled for **32 bit Cog VM**.
Cog VM is a default VM for Pharo, but Squeak all-in-one package still includes legacy VM only. So if you would like to use this pre-built plugin on Squeak, get the [Cog VM](http://www.mirandabanda.org/cogblog/downloads/) first.
